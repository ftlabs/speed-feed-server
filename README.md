# SpeedFeed server

**IMPORTANT** The speedFeed experiment has now ended, and the server was switched off. If you need to revive the service, follow the setup section below.

## What is SpeedFeed?
SpeedFeed explores the limits of annoyance, combining constant disruption with the usefulness of the latest headlines.

The server is used to get a prepared (chopped up word by word) and cached version of the latest headlines. The rest of the widget lives on Next.

## Setup
The node server will require 3 environment variables to run.
- `CAPI_ENDPOINT`
- `CAPI_HOST`
- `CAPI_KEY`
